A small simulation of Profit Estimation with UDF using R

An IVF Hospital Chain with a nationwide capacity of 1000 patients per month and 100 patients per center have been instructed to do annual budget planning. As part of the same, they are analyzing patient footfalls and revenues.
The chain follows a package pricing system. They makes $1000 profit per baby born, $200 for a twin, $-1000 for a triplet and $-2000 when it is a quadruplet. It makes no profit when there is a miscarriage.
The average footfall per month follows an uniform distribution between 72 to 84 per center. Analyzing the data from the past, you found there is a 25% chance of twin, 5% chance for a triplet, 1% chance of a quadruplet and 4% chance of miscarriage.

Given the CEO wants a detailed profit projection, can you help the IVF chain?
